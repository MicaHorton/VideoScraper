# What Does It Do
- Given a show name and season, find a list of links to each episode of the show.
- Download the show (which is served as a stream of .ts files not an .mp4 unfortunately) by extracting the 1080.m3u8 file (which has the paths to all the .ts files) and downloading all the .ts files into a folder which can be played by VLC media player.
- See videoNotes.md for more documentation
